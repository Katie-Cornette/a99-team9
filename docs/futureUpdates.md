# Future Additions to our project

### Clicking water icon to add to water count
- We would like to add a feature where you click a water droplet, cup, or bottle and it adds 8-16 oz to your water total instead of the user typing in the amount of water they have drank

### Resetting the water amount at the end of day
- Your daily goal resets at midnight your local time instead of accumulating
