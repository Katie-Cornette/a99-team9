# Planning

### Meeting with team:

#### Met with team on 11/29 to assign roles and brainstorm ideas
-Want to create a water tracker app that will track someone's water throughout the day when they click on a water bottle or water cup everytime they finish a drink
-Will need to create a log in page (using an api) that will be able to add new users and log exisiting users into the correct profile
-When new users join they are able to set a water goal or if they chose not to, a generic one will be assigned to them
-The main page will have a calendar for the month and picture buttons of a water cup or bottle to click when completing your drink. 
-The days that you have completed your water goal will turn blue on the calendar.

#### Potential Names:
-Dam Journal
-Hydrate or Diedrate
-Drip or Drown
-Fo' drizzle
